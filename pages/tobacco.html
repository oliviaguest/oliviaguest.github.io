    <p><blockquote>While opacity is a distinguishing feature of many other areas of science and technology, the myths surrounding computing may stem less from the fact that it is an opaque
esoteric subject and more from the way in which it can be seen to blur the boundary between people and machines (Turkle 1984). To be sure, most people do not understand
the workings of a television set or how to program their video cassette recorders properly, but then they do not usually believe that these machines can have intelligence. The
public myths about computing and AI are also no doubt due to the ways in which computers are often depicted in the mass media — e.g. as an abstract source of wisdom, or
as a mechanical brain.
