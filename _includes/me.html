    <p>Hi! I am an <a href="https://www.ru.nl/english/people/guest-o/">Assistant Professor of Computational Cognitive Science</a>.
    I work in the Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence department in the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/departments/faculty-of-social-sciences/donders-centre-for-cognition">Donders Centre for Cognition</a> and the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/education/bachelors/artificial-intelligence">School of Artificial Intelligence</a> at Radboud University in the Netherlands.</p>

    <p>My research interests comprise (meta)theoretical, critical, and radical perspectives on the neuro-, computational, and cognitive sciences broadly construed.
    Additionally, I am an Associate Editor-in-Chief for <a href="http://rescience.github.io/board/">ReScience C</a> and for the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/about#editorial_board">Journal of Open Source Software</a>.</p>

    <p>I am committed to <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/november-2020/bropenscience-broken-science">equity, diversity, and inclusion in (open) science</a>, e.g., <a href="https://neuroplausible.com/programming">promoting access to technical skills training</a> â€” including the broader <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14258">decolonisation of cognitive and computational sciences</a>.
    Relatedly, <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/bergmann-christina">Christina Bergmann</a> and I maintain a <a href="http://compcog.science/">list of underrepresented cognitive computational scientists</a>.</p>
