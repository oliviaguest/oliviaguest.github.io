<p>If you are interested in working with me, feel free to <a href="mailto:olivia.guest@ru.nl">contact me</a>. Prior to that, it might be worth taking a look at the following themes of research that currently interest me:
    <ul>
        <li>Critical perspectives on AI, its history, and its current state, including projects about artificial neural networks, sans hype.</li>
        <li>(Meta)theory development in neuro-, cognitive, computational, and psychological sciences.</li>
        <li>Human categorisation, and computational models thereof, from a perspective of what is lacking in our narrow framing of this human capacity.</li>
    </ul>
