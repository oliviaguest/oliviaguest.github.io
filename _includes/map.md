    ["Using this contradiction, these companies obscure their energy and water consumption in data centers and their societal and political harms.15 AI technologies are thus presented as indispensable to society, suggesting that only with the help of AI technologies we are able to fight, for example, the climate crisis — also known as technosolutionism. This even goes as far as suggestions that we all need to sacrifice our planet for unrealistic promises of the AI hype.16 Obviously, there is no planet B,17 and the Earth is more important than AI technologies with high environmental and social costs. — [](]Suarez et al (2025))"]
